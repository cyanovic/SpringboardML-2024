    "# Mini Project: Transfer Learning with Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is used as a starting point to solve a different but related task. Instead of training a model from scratch, transfer learning leverages the knowledge learned from the source task and applies it to the target task. This approach is especially useful when the target task has limited data or computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In transfer learning, the pre-trained model, also known as the \"base model\" or \"source model,\" is typically trained on a large dataset and a more general problem (e.g., image classification on ImageNet, a vast dataset with millions of labeled images). The knowledge learned by the base model in the form of feature representations and weights captures common patterns and features in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform transfer learning, the following steps are commonly followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pre-training: The base model is trained on a source task using a large dataset, which can take a considerable amount of time and computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Extraction: After pre-training, the base model is used as a feature extractor. The last few layers (classifier layers) of the model are discarded, and the remaining layers (feature extraction layers) are retained. These layers serve as feature extractors, producing meaningful representations of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fine-tuning: The feature extraction layers and sometimes some of the earlier layers are connected to a new set of layers, often called the \"classifier layers\" or \"task-specific layers.\" These layers are randomly initialized, and the model is trained on the target task with a smaller dataset. The weights of the base model can be frozen during fine-tuning, or they can be allowed to be updated with a lower learning rate to fine-tune the model for the target task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning has several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduced training time and resource requirements: Since the base model has already learned generic features, transfer learning can save time and resources compared to training a model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improved generalization: Transfer learning helps the model generalize better to the target task, especially when the target dataset is small and dissimilar from the source dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Better performance: By starting from a model that is already trained on a large dataset, transfer learning can lead to better performance on the target task, especially in scenarios with limited data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Effective feature extraction: The feature extraction layers of the pre-trained model can serve as powerful feature extractors for different tasks, even when the task domains differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is commonly used in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and speech recognition, where pre-trained models are fine-tuned for specific applications like object detection, sentiment analysis, or speech-to-text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mini-project you will perform fine-tuning using Keras with a pre-trained VGG16 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset."

    "VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group 16) is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that was developed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford. It was proposed by researchers Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman in their paper titled \"Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition,\" which was presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "The VGG16 architecture gained significant popularity for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks. It was one of the pioneering models that demonstrated the power of deeper neural networks for visual recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of the VGG16 architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Architecture: VGG16 consists of a total of 16 layers, hence the name \"16.\" These layers are stacked one after another, forming a deep neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Convolutional Layers: The main building blocks of VGG16 are the convolutional layers. It primarily uses 3x3 convolutional filters throughout the network, which allows it to capture local features effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Max Pooling: After each set of convolutional layers, VGG16 applies max-pooling layers with 2x2 filters and stride 2, which halves the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the feature maps and reduces the number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fully Connected Layers: Towards the end of the network, VGG16 has fully connected layers that act as a classifier to make predictions based on the learned features.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Activation Function: The network uses the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for all hidden layers, which helps with faster convergence during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Number of Filters: The number of filters in each convolutional layer is relatively small compared to more recent architectures like ResNet or InceptionNet. However, stacking multiple layers allows VGG16 to learn complex hierarchical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Output Layer: The output layer consists of 1000 units, corresponding to 1000 ImageNet classes. VGG16 was originally trained on the large-scale ImageNet dataset, which contains millions of images from 1000 different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "VGG16 was instrumental in showing that increasing the depth of a neural network can significantly improve its performance on image recognition tasks. However, the main drawback of VGG16 is its high number of parameters, making it computationally expensive and memory-intensive to train. Despite this limitation, VGG16 remains an essential benchmark architecture and has paved the way for even deeper and more efficient models in the field of computer vision, such as ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet."

Since there are 10 classes, random performance would be more complex than just 50:50 (50% accuracy) and would be substantially lower, I believe, so in that regard, with this multi-class variable, 60% is pretty good. However, it is not an optimal level of accuracy. I will try modifying some modifications. Since these models can take a while to run, I am not inclined to switch away from ReLU at this point, but if there were more time and resources, that could be something to try too, or changing the optimizer. For now, I'll see if a loss of 0.001 might improve accuracy if it is able to explore more of the space faster in 20 epochs. Alternatively, it could reduce accuracy, but I will see."
